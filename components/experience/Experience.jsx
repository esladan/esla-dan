My projects often involve collaboration with cross-functional teams, and I strive to deliver solutions that are both scalable and user-friendly.",
          "Team": "Collaboration is at the heart of my work. I thrive in team environments, where I contribute to brainstorming sessions, code reviews, and paired programming. Whether working with designers, product managers, or other developers, I aim to foster open communication, ensuring everyone is aligned on project goals and outcomes. I also enjoy mentoring junior developers and sharing knowledge within the team.",
          "Process": "I follow agile methodologies to ensure projects are delivered efficiently and with a focus on quality. From sprint planning to iterative development, I value structured processes that provide clear objectives while allowing flexibility. I rely on version control systems, automated testing, and continuous integration to maintain code quality and ensure smooth deployments. Documentation and feedback loops are integral to refining both the process and the final product."
